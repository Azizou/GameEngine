## Simple Game Engine ##
I wrote this following a tutorial on youtube. (Indeed a great place to learn!")
It basically create a basis for developping games in java and easy to extends as well. 
Currently, you can create a screen object, a factory object, a game object, the mouse and key listener are pretty much implemented for you

#Still need work though#

###Most importantly, I gotta make it work.### 
The damn game won't work, and I am not sure where the bug is. By it's nature, I will guess it is thread related. Cuz, All traces I have tried failed
